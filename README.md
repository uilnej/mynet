# mynet
prototype for mynet app 

made for CSCI5839-F17 
Assignment 6 

MyNet (Mycelium Network) is app for mushroom hunters to share and document findings. Many fungibased
apps are either reference oriented or seek to identify findings via photos. Reference oriented are
mostly field guides in digital form, allowing users to browse through findings to cross check what they
find in the field. The latter, however, relies on machine learning to identify the mushroom in the photo.
This technique can be very dangerous since they usually only use one photo and do not take into
account other methods of identification such as spore print, smell, taste and substrate growth in order
to make a correct ID.

The MyNet app is not an identification app, instead it is a way to connect mushroom hunters in order to
document and share what they find out in the field. Many hunters already use their phone as a way to
take pictures â€“ MyNet utilizes aspects of metadata from photos to create a social media networking app
specifically for the mushrooming community. This prototype was built using Figma and represents the
following tasks: accessing profile page; posting and responding to comments; browsing content; and
creating a library entry.

.png files of the individual frames for the app are located under the "spores (1)" folder. 
The figma file is located at spore.fig
